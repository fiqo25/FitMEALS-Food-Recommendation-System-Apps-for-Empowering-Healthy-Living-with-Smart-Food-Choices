### Dashboard Overview
This dashboard aims to address the daily consumption requirements, focusing primarily on nutrition and calorie needs based on age groups and food categories. Utilizing Power BI, we visualize and analyze these requirements to provide insights into optimal nutrient intake for different demographics.

## Problem Statement
Understanding the nutritional needs of various demographic groups is crucial for promoting healthy living. However, accessing and interpreting this information can be complex. This dashboard seeks to simplify the process by providing intuitive visualizations and analysis of daily consumption requirements based on age groups and food categories.

## Steps Followed
1. **Data Loading:** Loaded dataset from a CSV file into Power BI Desktop.
2. **Data Quality Check:** Utilized Power Query Editor to check column distribution, quality, and profile.
3. **Column Profiling:** Ensured column profiling based on the entire dataset.
4. **Error and Empty Values Check:** Confirmed the absence of errors and empty values in the dataset.
5. **Card Visuals:** Used card visuals to represent counts of carbohydrates, calories, proteins, fats, height, and weight.
6. **Age Group Slicer:** Implemented a slicer to filter data by age group.
7. **Category Slicer:** Utilized another slicer to filter data by category.
8. **Area Chart:** Displayed nutrient needs by age group using an area chart.
9. **Bar Chart:** Presented total carbohydrate, calorie, protein, and fat values by food using a bar chart.
10. **Publishing:** Published the report to Power BI Service.



### Dashboard Components
- **Card Visuals:** Representing counts of various nutrients, height, and weight.
- **Slicers:** Allowing users to filter data by age group and category.
- **Area Chart:** Visualizing nutrient needs by age group.
- **Bar Chart:** Displaying total nutrient values by category.

This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of daily consumption requirements, enabling users to make informed decisions about their nutrition intake based on age and food preferences.


# Insights

A single-page report was created in Power BI Desktop and subsequently published to Power BI Service. From the dashboard, the following insights can be derived:

1. The age group with the highest nutrient requirements in descending order is the 19-29 age group, with the following nutrient quantities needed:
   - Calories: 4900 kkal
   - Carbohydrates: 790 g
   - Protein: 125 g 
   - Fat: 140 g

2. The food item with the highest calorie count is "opak singkong."

3. The food item with the highest carbohydrate content is "pilus."

4. The food item with the highest protein content is "kerupuk kulit kerbau."

5. The food item with the highest fat content is "lemak babi."

These insights provide valuable information for understanding nutrient requirements across different age groups and identifying food items rich in specific nutrients.
